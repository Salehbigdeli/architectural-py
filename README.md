# Example application code for the python architecture book


## Requirements

* docker with docker-compose
* for chapters 1 and 2, and optionally for the rest: a local python3.7 virtualenv


## Building the containers

_(this is only required from chapter 3 onwards)_

```sh
make build
make up
# or
make all # builds, brings containers up, runs tests
```

## Creating a local virtualenv (optional)

```sh
python3.8 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate # or however you like to create virtualenvs

# for chapter 1
pip install pytest 

# for chapter 2
pip install pytest sqlalchemy

# for chapter 4+5
pip install requirements.txt

# for chapter 6+
pip install requirements.txt
pip install -e src/
```

<!-- TODO: use a make pipinstall command -->


## Running the tests

```sh
make test
# or, to run individual test types
make unit
make integration
make e2e
# or, if you have a local virtualenv
make up
pytest tests/unit
pytest tests/integration
pytest tests/e2e
```

## Makefile

There are more useful commands in the makefile, have a look and try them out.
